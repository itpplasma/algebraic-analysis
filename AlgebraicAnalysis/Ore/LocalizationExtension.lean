# Localization interface for derivation-Ore extensions

The proposition below is the exact output expected from a theorem saying that
localizing a derivation-Ore extension at coefficients gives the derivation-Ore
extension of the localized coefficient ring.  It packages data and its
compatibility law; it does not assert that the data exist.
