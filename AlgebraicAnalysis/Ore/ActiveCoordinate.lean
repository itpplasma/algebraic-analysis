# Active-coordinate decomposition in a derivation Ore extension

This file isolates a reusable algebraic interface for one distinguished
coefficient coordinate.  The coefficient ring may be noncommutative; the
coordinate is required to be central in that ring, while the active derivation
annihilates ground scalars and sends the coordinate to `1`.

The results use only the checked normal-form construction.  They do not
postulate a PBW basis, a presented Weyl algebra, or an operator realization.

/-- Hypotheses for one active differential-Ore coordinate.

The coefficient ring can be noncommutative. `coordinate_central` is the exact
hypothesis needed for coefficients of an active-variable expansion to commute
with polynomials in the coordinate. The two derivation hypotheses record that
the active derivation fixes ground scalars and differentiates the coordinate.
