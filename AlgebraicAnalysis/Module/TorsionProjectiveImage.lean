# A projective-image terminal module lemma

This file isolates the unconditional linear-algebra step in a torsion
presentation: a surjection from a product which kills its free factor factors
through the first factor.  It does not assert that a torsion module admits
such a presentation.

factor, and a quotient map kills that free factor, then the target is a
homomorphic image of the projective left ideal.  Here `I : Submodule R R` is
